# Obsolete

Unfortunately Transpordiamet no longer publishes data about free exam slots,
which this script relied on, so it is no longer functional.

# ARKMonitor

Monitor Estonian DMV driving exam slots, provide notifications via Twilio.
This project is not maintained, just a quick hack for self-use.

## Setup

1. Create .env from .env.example and fill data.
2. Install requirements for python
3. Run `python main.py` via task scheduler/cron.
